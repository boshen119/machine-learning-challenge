# machine-learning-challenge

Instructions
Preprocess the Data
Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
Separate the data into training and testing data.
Tune Model Parameters
Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.
Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.
Reporting
Create a README that reports a comparison of each modelâ€™s performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).

Grid Search

Hints and Considerations
Start by cleaning the data, removing unnecessary columns, and scaling the data.

Not all variables are significant be sure to remove any insignificant variables.

Make sure your sklearn package is up to date.

Try a simple model first, and then tune the model using GridSearch.

Submission
Create a Jupyter Notebook for each model and host the notebooks on GitHub.

Create a file for your best model and push to GitHub

Include a README.md file that summarizes your assumptions and findings.
